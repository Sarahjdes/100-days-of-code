# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3rd 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've worked on my Tribute page for Free Code Camp

**Thoughts** I am working with Bootstrap, and I realize I absolutely HATE it. I'll probably stop using it so much, only use a few cols and put some time on the CSS instead.

### Day 2: January 4th 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my Portfolio for Free Code Camp

**Thoughts** I wasn't having fun with Bootstrap yesterday, so I decided to switch to another project. I'll probably go back to my Tribute page at some point, but right now, what I need is a fun project, not one that I think of as a chore. I also signed up to be a mentor for a Ladies Learning Code workshop about HTML and CSS, so I might as well get back to these!

### Day 3: January 5th 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my Portfolio for Free Code Camp

**Thoughts** I moved the whole thing to my computer so I can work where I don't have Internet, plus I like to log my commits. I'll keep my codepen updated at the end of the day. Didn't do much, I need to dive back into CSS, it's been so long!

### Day 4: January 6th 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my Portfolio for Free Code Camp

**Thoughts** Fun fun fun with divs, added a whole lot of flashy colors! I found a bunch of documentation about CSS, I'll probably be reading that this weekend. I'm having some trouble verticaly aligning my bio, but I'll figure it out at some point.

### Day 5: January 7th 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my Portfolio for Free Code Camp

**Thoughts** Initial layout is pretty much done, all I need is to find good stock images and start working on the different sections of my actual portfolio!

### Day 6: January 8th 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Sunday Funday, worked on Advent Of Code 2016! (Python)

**Thoughts** I'm currently stuck on Day 13 (skipped a few) and I'm really stucked at finding how many moves it takes to go through a maze. Most of the challenge is done, and I might either simply print the maze and find the solution myself, or ask a friend about it!

### Day 7: January 9th 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Didn't work on projects, but reinvested what I had learned playing with Python for a project at work!

**Thoughts** I had a big day yesterday, so I didn't have a lot of spare time to code "for fun". But I did reinvest my Advent of Code knowledge to make a python script for work. I decided I'd make it could, as it was a "creative" job, I had a problem and needed to solve it. I'm glad it ended up working!

### Day 8: January 10th 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on second challenge of day 02 of Advent of Code

**Thoughts** I've decided to go back to playing on Advent of Code, having fun!

### Day 9: January 11th 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Still refactoring code from day 02 of Advent of Code

**Thoughts** Yesterday, I was trying to start from the code I had. Today, I opened up a new file and tried to completely rewrite my code in a more efficent manner. Works well!

### Day 10: January 12th 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Still refactoring code from day 02 of Advent of Code

**Thoughts** I don't know if I'm going forward, but at least, I'm not going backwards!

### Day 11: January 13th 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Heard about #DailyCSSImages. Of course I had to try it! Did the beginner's tutorial, and got started on Day01 image. 

**Thoughts** I wanted to try some CSS fun, and this challenge/project is exactly what I needed! It's fun and different from what I usually do. Artsy, but mathsy as well. I don't think I can do one daily, but I sure can do one or two weekly during my 100 days of code :)

### Day 12: January 14th 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished yesterday's CSS project, followed an intermediate tutorial

**Thoughts** It's easier than I thought! To be honest, I always thought CSS was weird, but I'm getting the hang of it and feeling like a real artist :)

### Day 13: January 16th 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Skipped yesterday, I went outside instead, and it felt soooo good. Today, I worked on day02 of #DailyCSSImages, which is an elephant. So far so good! Still trying to figure out how I'll draw the trunk. 

**Thoughts** Getting away from your computer is often beneficial! It felt good to take a break yesterday. This doesn't count towards my 100 days, so today is day 13. U Go GURL!

### Day 14: January 17th 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Almost done with my elephant, but I need new colors! I also played with ZSH in iTerm2, fun fun fun! 

**Thoughts** I heard about ZSH today and decided to give it a shot. It was a little frustrating at first, but once you have it set up, there seem to be a lot of possibilities!

### Day 15: January 18th 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Day03 of Daily CSS Images, almost done with my beaver!

**Thoughts** I needed a little more challenge, so I decided to do the body as well. Not quite sure if it looks good, but it's still a little more challenging. At some point, I'll also need to make a page where I can showcase my daily CSS art. I can even include it in my portfolio! (Still need to finish that project as well!)

### Day 16: January 19th 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Day04 of Daily CSS Images, tiger! 

**Thoughts** I'm still confused on how (and if!) it is possible to do half of a circle for the chin. We'll see!

### Day 17: January 20th 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Day04 of Daily CSS Images, tiger! 

**Thoughts** Almost done with my tiger, but I think I need a new project. How about a Slack Bot?

### Day 18: January 21th 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started working on my very first Slackbot!

**Thoughts** New challenge today, making a bot! I was tired of CSS drawing, so here's something new to play with!

### Day 19: January 22nd 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Day04 of Daily CSS Images, animal of choice!

**Thoughts** I've already done an elephant, but not from behind! (Which was sooo much easier than drawing its face!) I think I'll stop working on the #DailyCSSImages and keep those for the weekends, or at least in between projects :) I can now say that despite my lack of drawing skills, I am a-little-good at Pure CSS drawing!

### Day 20: January 23rd 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC JS algorithms

**Thoughts** It's been forever since I last did some JS algorithms. I had stopped because it was getting a little hard for me. Since then, I've been doing some Python, which really did help with the whole aldorithm logic. Today, I only had to google the proper syntax and such, bevause I was getting kinda rusty, forgetting my semi-colons and my curly braces!


### Day 21: January 24th 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC JS algorithms

**Thoughts** Still working on 'em! 


### Day 22: January 25th 2017, Wedndesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a new slackbot, a rock paper scissors one

**Thoughts** I've come to the conclusion that I didn't really know where I was going with my h2o-slackbot. What did I want it to do? So I switched to a new one, which will essentially play rock paper scissors. Simple, and I know which flow I want it to follow.

[Slackbots repo](https://github.com/Sarahjdes/slackbots)


### Day 23: January 26th 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on rock-paper-scissors (RPS) Slackbot

**Thoughts** Doing good! Bot picks its move and added attachments. It's not pretty, I've added way too many fields that are not mandatory, but it helps me get to know what can be done. I'm also a lot more confident when it comes to what I am doing and how the bots work. One of my best days so for!

### Day 24: January 27th 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked with Webflow

**Thoughts** I redid a landing page at work, and had to use Webflow. With the Daily CSS Images challenge, I used CSS more within the last week than I did during the past years. Webflow didn't require code, but it did require the logic of creating divs with classes. It was a great exercice that was in reinvested what I learned with #100DaysOfCode, so even if it was work-related, I decided it counted #imaketherules ;) 


### Day 25: January 28th 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Mentored at a HTML/CSS workshop

**Thoughts** I volunteered at a beginner HTML/CSS workshop for Ladies Learning Code. You remember 5% of what you hear, 10% of what you read, 75% of that you do (yay for coding!) and 90% of what you teach. Besides the portfolio I started for FCC, I haven't done many websites recently, so it got me back into the whole HTML-CSS layouts, and I got to mentor women doing it for the first time. And I'll probably remember 90%. Because 100 Days of Code is also about diversity in what you're doing!


### Day 26: January 29th 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on RPS Slackbot

**Thoughts** Wrote a few function for my RPS Slackbot! These functions will be used to decide who wins (Slackbot vs. User) and what the bot picks.

[Slackbots repo](https://github.com/Sarahjdes/slackbots)


### Day 27: January 30th 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on RPS Slackbot

**Thoughts** Started playing with conversations. I'm having problem with the order of what my bot says. I'll keep looking at examples and read documentation!

### Day 28: January 31st 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on portfolio 

**Thoughts** I came back to playing with my portfolio! Seeing women building their first webpage during LLC Saturday gave me the kick I needed to come back to my portfolio. I also intend to host it on Github Pages once I'm done

### Day 29: February 1st 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about nodeJS

**Thoughts** To me, Node was that thing I would use to run either scripts or projects. I could also use NPM to download packages. This is all I knew about it! I found an interesting series of videos about it on LearnCode.academy, so I've been watching those and trying my own stuff on the side. Fun fun fun! I already understand a bit more how it works.


### Day 30: February 3rd 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked an automatisation script (BASH) for work purposes

**Thoughts** When people ask me how I studied to be a teacher (wasn't my jam after all), started working as a trainer in an EdTech startup and ended in the dev department, I can't help it but quote Bill Gates : « I choose a lazy person to do a hard job because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it. » I had a lot of copy-paste jobs, which I hated. So slowly, I started looking into our app code to create very simple scripts that would do the job for me. Smart, uh? So today, I found out one of my colleagues had a humongous job to do. So I jumped right in and developed a script, making sure it would be reusable. Once I ran my script, the whole thing took about 7 minutes. « Woah, and how do I learn to do that? » Baby steps ;) 


### Day 31: February 4th 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on portfolio

**Thoughts** Sick day, worked on my portfolio, I didn't get much done, but I did code. 

**Link(s) to work**
[My Portfolio](http://codepen.io/sarahjdes/full/Bpyzpr/)


### Day 32: February 5th 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC algorithms

**Thoughts** Still sick, I worked on an FCC algorithms. I started using nodemon to run them in terminal. Everytime I save my .js file, it runs again automaticaly, so I don't need to run node over and over again. Love it! 


### Day 33: February 6th 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Created a random quote machine for FCC

**Thoughts** Started working on the FCC random quote machine! I'm almost done with it already, it needs more styling, but that's pretty much it :) 


### Day 34: February 7th 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Created a script for work! (IF)

**Thoughts** I totally get the "work doesn't count", but I take my personnal time to work on on something work-related, it counts :) And I am having fun. I wrote a script to automate part of my coworker's job, and I had so much fun. It is a bash script, so I even added ASCII text and image, with color and all, so I went crazy, and that was fun! 


### Day 35: February 8th 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished my random quote machine!

**Thoughts** I'm done with my random quote machine! It works, it tweets, yay! All I need now is to add a lot of new wonderful quotes from the author I picked.  

[My Random Quote Machine](http://codepen.io/sarahjdes/pen/jyeNBO)


### Day 36: February 10th 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC algorithms

**Thoughts** Still working on FCC algorithms. I've been working a lot lately, and I don't have much energy to put into recreational coding once I come back from work. It's been hard to keep going! Skipped yesterday, but managed to do hald an hour today. 


### Day 37: February 11th 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC algorithms

**Thoughts** Still working on FCC algorithms. I've been stuck for DAYS on the same one, and this is getting very frustrating. But I'll get it at some point.  


### Day 38: February 13th 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Trying to figure out the Weather FCC project

**Thoughts** Started working on the FCC Weather app. Trying to figure out how openweathermap works!


### Day 39: February 14th 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Contributed to someone else's project for the 1st time!

**Thoughts** For the first time, I forked a project and submitted a pull request. Nothing fancy, juste a few FR translations (perks of being a French speaker!), but that was my first time, and I'm proud to be giving a little bit of my time to a fellow #100DaysOfCode 'player' :)

### Day 40: February 15th 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Back to Daily CSS Images! Clock

**Thoughts** I've decided to go back to Daily CSS Images! That is the perfect thing to do whenever I am busy. It doesn't take me long to get into it, so even if I cannot do a full hour that day, I'm still able to do some code. I'd rather do 30 minutes of code than none! 

[Daily CSS Images repo](https://github.com/Sarahjdes/dailycssimages)


### Day 41: February 16th 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Still working on my CSS Clock image

**Thoughts** My clock is looking good so far, I'm getting quicker at positioning my elements (the numbers!), but I need to find a font that allows me to do cool roman numbers :)

[Daily CSS Images repo](https://github.com/Sarahjdes/dailycssimages)


### Day 42: February 17th 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finished my CSS Clock image

**Thoughts** Finished my clock! I wonder if I can start from this project, and make an actual clock that will display the time! Hmmm, there is definetly something to do with that!

[Daily CSS Images repo](https://github.com/Sarahjdes/dailycssimages)


### Day 43: February 18th 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a CSS Ruler image! 

**Thoughts** Worked, from start to finish, on a CSS image. The challenge was to make a ruler, which reminded me of a "You rock - You rule" illustration I liked very much. I now have my own, and it's all CSS made! I'm soooo proud of it, this is probably the CSS image on which I worked the hardest and which looks the nicer. I had to actually understand the whole clip-path thing, which would have helped me with other designs I made previously. Yay for me, I both rock and rule! Call me the CSS princess. 

[Daily CSS Images repo](https://github.com/Sarahjdes/dailycssimages)


### Day 44: February 19th 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a CSS Notepad image! 

**Thoughts** Drew a notepad and decided to add a pencil next to it! I'm getting a lot better at CSS, I really do see a difference between what I could do at the beginning of the challenge and now. Yay!  

[Daily CSS Images repo](https://github.com/Sarahjdes/dailycssimages)


### Day 45: February 20th 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Learning about MEANjs

**Thoughts** That was something completely new to me! Not much coding, but a lot of research.


### Day 46: February 21st 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: First app using Express & MongoDB!

**Thoughts** I did follow a tutorial for this one, but it was awesome to see that a very simple app had the same folders, files and functions than a much bigger app, like the one we have at work! 


### Day 47: February 22nd 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Vagrant, MongoDB & More CSS

**Thoughts** After trying (very hard!) to install a Vagrant machine along with MongoDB, I gave up and went to work on some CSS image : a calendar

[Daily CSS Images repo](https://github.com/Sarahjdes/dailycssimages)


### Day 48: February 23rd 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Express & MongoDB

**Thoughts** Finished a tutorial I started Tuesday, I learned about the Update and Delete. I then re-installed Express, Npm and MongoDB to make my own app. I had this nutrition app project with a friend of mine. Nothing that will change the world, but it is going to be a fun exercice! 


### Day 49: February 24th 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: MongoDB readings and BASH scripting for BievenueForce

**Thoughts** I automated a nunch of tasks for work, and today was THE test. I've said it in the past, but as this is not something I was asked to build for work, but rather an initiative of my own to make my job easier AND learn new things, I am including it in my 100DOC. I added a few IF in my code. I will need to clean up my code, as there are a lof of outputs and other things that are saved that I don't really need. I'm also reading "MongoDB : The Definitive Guide" from O'Reilly, and it is super interesting! I really want to read the whole thing in order to know the possibilities of what can be done with MongoDB for my nutrition app.  


### Day 50: February 25th 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: MongoDB readings and playing

**Thoughts** Who's halfway through 100 Days of Code? Uh, that might be me! I didn't think I would make it that far. I only skipped two days so far, and I'm proud of what I've done! 


### Day 51: February 26th 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: MongoDB readings and such

**Thoughts** Still getting to know more about MongoDB, and I'm getting quite good at it!


### Day 52: February 27th 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: MongoDB, eat, sleep, repeat!

**Thoughts** More MongoDB, and starting the Flatiron School Bootcamp Prep course


### Day 53: February 28th 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Flatiron School Bootcamp Prep course

**Thoughts** Right now, I already know pretty much everything I'm reading about, or in the labs, but there will be Ruby at some point! 


### Day 54: March 1st 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Flatiron School Bootcamp Prep course + helped a fellow student!

**Thoughts** Got to help a fellow student, it was a lot of fun! There is this chart that says you remember 75% of what you do, and 90% or what you teach. Well I got that 90%! 


### Day 55: March 2nd 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Flatiron School Bootcamp Prep + Back to CSS!

**Thoughts** Finished my DCI calendar and did the pencil jar as well :) I'm really getting good at this, and I'm quite proud of it! 

[Daily CSS Images repo](https://github.com/Sarahjdes/dailycssimages)


### Day 56: March 3rd 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Flatiron School Bootcamp Prep (Scope)

**Thoughts** Stuck on a scope lab


### Day 57: March 4th 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Flatiron School Bootcamp Prep (Scope)

**Thoughts** Still stuck on a scope lab


### Day 58: March 5th 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Flatiron School Bootcamp Prep (Scope)

**Thoughts** Still stuck on that scope lab


### Day 59: March 6th 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Flatiron School Bootcamp Prep (Scope)

**Thoughts** Finally unstuck that scope lab! Only to see that I wasn't starting from the good thing. Dang. 


### Day 60: March 7th 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: purpleApp!

**Thoughts** My nutriApp became a purpleApp. I am still working toward a logging app, but not about nutrition.


### Day 61: March 8th 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: purpleApp!

**Thoughts** Once again, playing with the whole crud thing. I spent quite a lot of time on the deleting request, still not sure I correctly understand everything :-/ 


### Day 62: March 9th 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: BASH! writing scripts to make my job easier

**Thoughts** Ok, let's face it : the more time I spend playing with BASH-scripting, the worse I realize it is. I did my first case/switch statement today. The syntax is horrible! But bash is great to easily automate things, right? 


### Day 63: March 10th 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Sonic Pi and DailyCSSImages!

**Thoughts** I started to play with Sonic Pi, then realized that altought it is quite easy to make a few notes, it will take a lot of time for an ex-clarinetist like me to make something I would be proud of! So off I go, back to my DailyCSSImages. Pizza? Ja! 


### Day 64: March 11th 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: DailyCSSImages : burger

**Thoughts** I Working on a css burger! I found a really cool palette, so at least, I do not have to worry about that aspect of it. Still, I am finding it hard to make it round-ish, even with border-radius. 

[Daily CSS Images repo](https://github.com/Sarahjdes/dailycssimages)


### Day 65: March 12th 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: DailyCSSImages : burger (still!)

### Day 66: March 13th 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: DailyCSSImages : burger texture (done!)

**Thoughts** Finally done with my burger! I added some texture to the pickle using the ::after pseudo class to make crescent shaped bumps, and even added some gradient to the tomato. 

[Daily CSS Images repo](https://github.com/Sarahjdes/dailycssimages)


### Day 67: March 14th 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: DailyCSSImages : it's Taco Tuesday! (And bunch of BASH)

**Thoughts** Started a taco shell! Didn't get much done, but I had time to kill while taking the metro. 

[Daily CSS Images repo](https://github.com/Sarahjdes/dailycssimages)


### Day 68: March 15th 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: DailyCSSImages : Taco, still!

**Thoughts** I've been adding meat-beans, guacamole and sour cream to my taco. I should be able to finish it tomorrow.Having Internet at home really does help when I need to find online resources! 

[Daily CSS Images repo](https://github.com/Sarahjdes/dailycssimages)


### Day 69: March 16th 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Khan Academy : Algorithms!

**Thoughts** My friend has been talking to me about her algorithms uni course for weeks. So I decided to give the Khan Academy algorithms course a shot. Very interesting so far, I've been learning about linear and binary searches. 


### Day 70: March 17th 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: TGIF, I'm off for a week! Back to Khan Academy : Algorithms!

**Thoughts** Not moving very fast, still on the binary search, but I finally had it to work. 


### Day 71: March 18th 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: A bit of algorithms for KA

**Thoughts** Algorithms are harder then I thought. Currently reading about the time it takes to execute one, and I'm totally lost. Logarithms have always been something I've struggled with, ever since high school. 


### Day 72: March 19th 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: FCC, back to JS basics!

**Thoughts** Algorithms are harder then I thought. Currently reading about the time it takes to execute one, and I'm totally lost. Logarithms have always been something I've struggled with, ever sinc


### Day 73: March 20th 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: FCC, done with Object Oriented and Functional Programming!

**Thoughts** I have a crazy goal for this week : I want to finish the freeCodeCamp Front End Development Certification. I mean, it is crazy. But I want to break it down and choose a more realistic goal. But I'm done with JS Basics :) 


### Day 74: March 21st 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: FCC : Basic Algorithm Scripting

**Thoughts** Currently stuck on Falsy Bouncer, with the whole .filter() Arf! 


### Day 75: March 22nd 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: FCC : Finised Basic Algos and jQuery

**Thoughts** I'm finally done with those basic algorithms! Even the ones I had a lot of trouble with. (Been on them for months.) I also did the whole jQuery section. Tomorrow, I'm finishing my HTML/CSS and Bootstrap projects


### Day 76: March 23rd 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: FCC : Tribute Page, Porfolio and Weather app.

**Thoughts** Finally done with Tribute and Portfolio! I kept pushing them away. I also began to code the weather app, and I'm almost done with it. Yay! 

[My Tribute Page](https://codepen.io/sarahjdes/full/dpxrZX)

### Day 77: March 24th 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: FCC : Weather app

**Thoughts** I don't have as much time as I wished I had today to work on my weather app, but I'm working hard on it. So fart, I can parse the info from a json format to display it on an html page. Yay! Geolocation works, but I cannot get the json info from the API. I kind of know how, but it is not working properly, there are a few bugs.

### Day 78: March 25th 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: FCC : Weather app (still!)

**Thoughts** Totally stuck on the .getJSON method. But I'll debug it, one day left if I want to achieve the goal I gave myself this week, I need to finish this challenge!

### Day 79: March 26th 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: FCC : Weather app (arf!)

**Thoughts** I'm still trying to figure out why the .getJSON won't work.

### Day 80: March 27th 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: FCC : Weather app (kinda got the .getJSON to work!)

**Thoughts** The problem seems to come from Codepen, so I've decided to simply create an HTML file on my computer, and it seems to be working. Still not done, but definitly getting there!

### Day 81: March 28th 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: FCC : Weather app (back to Codepen!)

**Thoughts** I'm trying to figure out why some things work on my computer, but not on Codepen. I've read something about cross-origin. Could that be it? Read, Search, Ask, not giving up!

### Day 82: March 29th 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: FCC : Intermediate Algorithm Scripting

**Thoughts** Needed to get my head out of my weather app, so I've started Intermerdiate algos, but I'm also stuck. I was thinking about pursuing the 100DOC for for than a 100 days, but I feel like I would use a little rest! 


### Day 83: March 30th 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Enki! 

**Thoughts** I just sat with my phone and worked on multiple exercices on my Enki app, that was fun! Maybe not for a full hour, but I really like this app so far, I'm learning a lot of cool stuff, but also re-reading stuff I used to know and completely forgot about. Every workout takes about 5-6 minutes, short and sweet, great for the buss ride (and not as bulky as having a laptop sitting on your lap!)


### Day 84: March 31st 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Debugging in the terminal

**Thoughts** Big day, and I didn't much time for recreative coding, but I did have to play with data in my terminal to find some lost data. I never understood why my code didn't run properly on my first try, but I did manage to find the input lines that didn't execute, and execute them. 


### Day 85: April 1st 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Enki, encore!

**Thoughts** This weekend is Women Techmakers, and I'm attending it, whoop whoop! This means there isn't much time to code, so I did a few workouts with Enki. It's quick and easy to do on the bus. The only thing is that I am not set up to take notes, so I simply bookmark them, telling myself I'll take notes later. Oh well! (WTM17 is awesome!)


### Day 86: April 2nd 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Enki and codewars

**Thoughts** My WTC17 weekend was awesome, but I'm so tired! A little Enki will do the trick for tonight :) 


### Day 87: April 3rd 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Enki and a bit of node

**Thoughts** Another long day, didn't have much time to code, but I did do a few Enki workouts and started a node project with a colleague


### Day 88: April 4th 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: LearnYouNode!

**Thoughts** I started LearYouNode today, and I like it! I want to maste node, as I will be using it for a project at work


### Day 89: April 5th 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Keeping up with LearnYouNode

**Thoughts** I really like LearnYouNode, as it is done inside your own terminal. No website needed! Very useful. Node itself is super duper interesting! 


### Day 90: April 6th 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Still learning with LearnYouNode!

**Thoughts** Oooh, I finally understood what callbacks are all about! This will debug me on a lot of projects I am currently working on that simply "weren't working". 


### Day 91: April 7th 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: A bit of LearnYouNode, once again! 

**Thoughts** I'm still progressing with LearnYouNode, and everything makes more sense. I'm currently reading "The Art of Node" by maxogden, and it's very well written! 


### Day 92: April 8th 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Kicking butts with LearnYouNode!

**Thoughts** Finished yet another challenge of LearnYouNode. Finally really getting comfortable with callbacks!
