# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Janyary 3rd 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've worked on my Tribute page for Free Code Camp

**Thoughts** I am working with Bootstrap, and I realize I absolutely HATE it. I'll probably stop using it so much, only use a few cols and put some time on the CSS instead.
