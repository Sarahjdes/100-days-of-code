# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3rd 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've worked on my Tribute page for Free Code Camp

**Thoughts** I am working with Bootstrap, and I realize I absolutely HATE it. I'll probably stop using it so much, only use a few cols and put some time on the CSS instead.

### Day 2: January 4th 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my Portfolio for Free Code Camp

**Thoughts** I wasn't having fun with Bootstrap yesterday, so I decided to switch to another project. I'll probably go back to my Tribute page at some point, but right now, what I need is a fun project, not one that I think of as a chore. I also signed up to be a mentor for a Ladies Learning Code workshop about HTML and CSS, so I might as well get back to these!

### Day 3: January 5th 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my Portfolio for Free Code Camp

**Thoughts** I moved the whole thing to my computer so I can work where I don't have Internet, plus I like to log my commits. I'll keep my codepen updated at the end of the day. Didn't do much, I need to dive back into CSS, it's been so long!

### Day 4: January 6th 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my Portfolio for Free Code Camp

**Thoughts** Fun fun fun with divs, added a whole lot of flashy colors! I found a bunch of documentation about CSS, I'll probably be reading that this weekend. I'm having some trouble verticaly aligning my bio, but I'll figure it out at some point.

### Day 5: January 7th 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my Portfolio for Free Code Camp

**Thoughts** Initial layout is pretty much done, all I need is to find good stock images and start working on the different sections of my actual portfolio!

### Day 6: January 8th 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Sunday Funday, worked on Advent Of Code 2016! (Python)

**Thoughts** I'm currently stuck on Day 13 (skipped a few) and I'm really stucked at finding how many moves it takes to go through a maze. Most of the challenge is done, and I might either simply print the maze and find the solution myself, or ask a friend about it!

### Day 7: January 9th 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Didn't work on projects, but reinvested what I had learned playing with Python for a project at work!

**Thoughts** I had a big day yesterday, so I didn't have a lot of spare time to code "for fun". But I did reinvest my Advent of Code knowledge to make a python script for work. I decided I'd make it could, as it was a "creative" job, I had a problem and needed to solve it. I'm glad it ended up working!

### Day 8: January 10th 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on second challenge of day 02 of Advent of Code

**Thoughts** I've decided to go back to playing on Advent of Code, having fun!

### Day 9: January 11th 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Still refactoring code from day 02 of Advent of Code

**Thoughts** Yesterday, I was trying to start from the code I had. Today, I opened up a new file and tried to completely rewrite my code in a more efficent manner. Works well!

### Day 10: January 12th 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Still refactoring code from day 02 of Advent of Code

**Thoughts** I don't know if I'm going forward, but at least, I'm not going backwards!

### Day 11: January 13th 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Heard about #DailyCSSImages. Of course I had to try it! Did the beginner's tutorial, and got started on Day01 image. 

**Thoughts** I wanted to try some CSS fun, and this challenge/project is exactly what I needed! It's fun and different from what I usually do. Artsy, but mathsy as well. I don't think I can do one daily, but I sure can do one or two weekly during my 100 days of code :)

### Day 12: January 14th 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished yesterday's CSS project, followed an intermediate tutorial

**Thoughts** It's easier than I thought! To be honest, I always thought CSS was weird, but I'm getting the hang of it and feeling like a real artist :)

### Day 13: January 16th 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Skipped yesterday, I went outside instead, and it felt soooo good. Today, I worked on day02 of #DailyCSSImages, which is an elephant. So far so good! Still trying to figure out how I'll draw the trunk. 

**Thoughts** Getting away from your computer is often beneficial! It felt good to take a break yesterday. This doesn't count towards my 100 days, so today is day 13. U Go GURL!

### Day 14: January 17th 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Almost done with my elephant, but I need new colors! I also played with ZSH in iTerm2, fun fun fun! 

**Thoughts** I heard about ZSH today and decided to give it a shot. It was a little frustrating at first, but once you have it set up, there seem to be a lot of possibilities!

### Day 15: January 18th 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Day03 of Daily CSS Images, almost done with my beaver!

**Thoughts** I needed a little more challenge, so I decided to do the body as well. Not quite sure if it looks good, but it's still a little more challenging. At some point, I'll also need to make a page where I can showcase my daily CSS art. I can even include it in my portfolio! (Still need to finish that project as well!)

### Day 16: January 19th 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Day04 of Daily CSS Images, tiger! 

**Thoughts** I'm still confused on how (and if!) it is possible to do half of a circle for the chin. We'll see!

### Day 17: January 20th 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Day04 of Daily CSS Images, tiger! 

**Thoughts** Almost done with my tiger, but I think I need a new project. How about a Slack Bot?

### Day 18: January 21th 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started working on my very first Slackbot!

**Thoughts** New challenge today, making a bot! I was tired of CSS drawing, so here's something new to play with!

### Day 19: January 22nd 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Day04 of Daily CSS Images, animal of choice!

**Thoughts** I've already done an elephant, but not from behind! (Which was sooo much easier than drawing its face!) I think I'll stop working on the #DailyCSSImages and keep those for the weekends, or at least in between projects :) I can now say that despite my lack of drawing skills, I am a-little-good at Pure CSS drawing!

### Day 20: January 23rd 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC JS algorithms

**Thoughts** It's been forever since I last did some JS algorithms. I had stopped because it was getting a little hard for me. Since then, I've been doing some Python, which really did help with the whole aldorithm logic. Today, I only had to google the proper syntax and such, bevause I was getting kinda rusty, forgetting my semi-colons and my curly braces!


### Day 21: January 24th 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC JS algorithms

**Thoughts** Still working on 'em! 


### Day 22: January 25th 2017, Wedndesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a new slackbot, a rock paper scissors one

**Thoughts** I've come to the conclusion that I didn't really know where I was going with my h2o-slackbot. What did I want it to do? So I switched to a new one, which will essentially play rock paper scissors. Simple, and I know which flow I want it to follow.

### Day 23: January 26th 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on rock-paper-scissors (RPS) Slackbot

**Thoughts** Doing good! Bot picks its move and added attachments. It's not pretty, I've added way too many fields that are not mandatory, but it helps me get to know what can be done. I'm also a lot more confident when it comes to what I am doing and how the bots work. One of my best days so for!

### Day 24: January 27th 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked with Webflow

**Thoughts** I redid a landing page at work, and had to use Webflow. With the Daily CSS Images challenge, I used CSS more within the last week than I did during the past years. Webflow didn't require code, but it did require the logic of creating divs with classes. It was a great exercice that was in reinvested what I learned with #100DaysOfCode, so even if it was work-related, I decided it counted #imaketherules ;) 


### Day 25: January 28th 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Mentored at a HTML/CSS workshop

**Thoughts** I volunteered at a beginner HTML/CSS workshop for Ladies Learning Code. You remember 5% of what you hear, 10% of what you read, 75% of that you do (yay for coding!) and 90% of what you teach. Besides the portfolio I started for FCC, I haven't done many websites recently, so it got me back into the whole HTML-CSS layouts, and I got to mentor women doing it for the first time. And I'll probably remember 90%. Because 100 Days of Code is also about diversity in what you're doing!


### Day 26: January 29th 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on RPS Slackbot

**Thoughts** Wrote a few function for my RPS Slackbot! These functions will be used to decide who wins (Slackbot vs. User) and what the bot picks.

### Day 27: January 30th 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on RPS Slackbot

**Thoughts** Started playing with conversations. I'm having problem with the order of what my bot says. I'll keep looking at examples and read documentation!

### Day 28: January 31st 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on portfolio 

**Thoughts** I came back to playing with my portfolio! Seeing women building their first webpage during LLC Saturday gave me the kick I needed to come back to my portfolio. I also intend to host it on Github Pages once I'm done

### Day 29: February 1st 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about nodeJS

**Thoughts** To me, Node was that thing I would use to run either scripts or projects. I could also use NPM to download packages. This is all I knew about it! I found an interesting series of videos about it on LearnCode.academy, so I've been watching those and trying my own stuff on the side. Fun fun fun! I already understand a bit more how it works.


### Day 30: February 3rd 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked an automatisation script (BASH) for work purposes

**Thoughts** When people ask me how I studied to be a teacher (wasn't my jam after all), started working as a trainer in an EdTech startup and ended in the dev department, I can't help it but quote Bill Gates : « I choose a lazy person to do a hard job because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it. » I had a lot of copy-paste jobs, which I hated. So slowly, I started looking into our app code to create very simple scripts that would do the job for me. Smart, uh? So today, I found out one of my colleagues had a humongous job to do. So I jumped right in and developed a script, making sure it would be reusable. Once I ran my script, the whole thing took about 7 minutes. « Woah, and how do I learn to do that? » Baby steps ;) 


### Day 31: February 4th 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on portfolio

**Thoughts** Sick day, worked on my portfolio, I didn't get much done, but I did code.

### Day 32: February 5th 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC algorithms

**Thoughts** Still sick, I worked on an FCC algorithms. I started using nodemon to run them in terminal. Everytime I save my .js file, it runs again automaticaly, so I don't need to run node over and over again. Love it! 


### Day 33: February 6th 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Created a random quote machine for FCC

**Thoughts** Started working on the FCC random quote machine! I'm almost done with it already, it needs more styling, but that's pretty much it :) 


### Day 34: February 7th 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Created a script for work! (IF)

**Thoughts** I totally get the "work doesn't count", but I take my personnal time to work on on something work-related, it counts :) And I am having fun. I wrote a script to automate part of my coworker's job, and I had so much fun. It is a bash script, so I even added ASCII text and image, with color and all, so I went crazy, and that was fun! 


### Day 35: February 8th 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished my random quote machine!

**Thoughts** I'm done with my random quote machine! It works, it tweets, yay! All I need now is to add a lot of new wonderful quotes from the author I picked.

### Day 36: February 10th 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC algorithms

**Thoughts** Still working on FCC algorithms. I've been working a lot lately, and I don't have much energy to put into recreational coding once I come back from work. It's been hard to keep going! Skipped yesterday, but managed to do hald an hour today. 


### Day 37: February 11th 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC algorithms

**Thoughts** Still working on FCC algorithms. I've been stuck for DAYS on the same one, and this is getting very frustrating. But I'll get it at some point.  


### Day 38: February 13th 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Trying to figure out the Weather FCC project

**Thoughts** Started working on the FCC Weather app. Trying to figure out how openweathermap works!
