# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3rd 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've worked on my Tribute page for Free Code Camp

**Thoughts** I am working with Bootstrap, and I realize I absolutely HATE it. I'll probably stop using it so much, only use a few cols and put some time on the CSS instead.

### Day 2: January 4th 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my Portfolio for Free Code Camp

**Thoughts** I wasn't having fun with Bootstrap yesterday, so I decided to switch to another project. I'll probably go back to my Tribute page at some point, but right now, what I need is a fun project, not one that I think of as a chore. I also signed up to be a mentor for a Ladies Learning Code workshop about HTML and CSS, so I might as well get back to these!

### Day 3: January 5th 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my Portfolio for Free Code Camp

**Thoughts** I moved the whole thing to my computer so I can work where I don't have Internet, plus I like to log my commits. I'll keep my codepen updated at the end of the day. Didn't do much, I need to dive back into CSS, it's been so long!

### Day 4: January 6th 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my Portfolio for Free Code Camp

**Thoughts** Fun fun fun with divs, added a whole lot of flashy colors! I found a bunch of documentation about CSS, I'll probably be reading that this weekend. I'm having some trouble verticaly aligning my bio, but I'll figure it out at some point.

### Day 5: January 7th 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my Portfolio for Free Code Camp

**Thoughts** Initial layout is pretty much done, all I need is to find good stock images and start working on the different sections of my actual portfolio!

### Day 6: January 8th 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Sunday Funday, worked on Advent Of Code 2016! (Python)

**Thoughts** I'm currently stuck on Day 13 (skipped a few) and I'm really stucked at finding how many moves it takes to go through a maze. Most of the challenge is done, and I might either simply print the maze and find the solution myself, or ask a friend about it!

### Day 7: January 9th 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Didn't work on projects, but reinvested what I had learned playing with Python for a project at work!

**Thoughts** I had a big day yesterday, so I didn't have a lot of spare time to code "for fun". But I did reinvest my Advent of Code knowledge to make a python script for work. I decided I'd make it could, as it was a "creative" job, I had a problem and needed to solve it. I'm glad it ended up working!

### Day 9: January 11th 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Still refactoring code from day 02 of Advent of Code

**Thoughts** Yesterday, I was trying to start from the code I had. Today, I opened up a new file and tried to completely rewrite my code in a more efficent manner. Works well!
